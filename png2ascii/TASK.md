                ASCII Art Generator
---------------------------------------------------
In this challenge, you are tasked to create a ascii
art generator that accepts a PNG image and prints
to the console the result (google ascii art if you
don't know). For beginners, all you have to do is
use a library.

For intermediates, i suggest implementing your own
PNG reader and then using that to print the values
(for more challenge!!). You may use a built-in
library for stuff like zlib, but the actual parser
must be made by you.

                 QR Code Generator
---------------------------------------------------
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a
QR code generator that takes a string input and
generates a QR code image from it. For beginners,
you can use a library to handle the QR code
generation.

For intermediates, I suggest implementing your own
QR code encoding algorithm. You may use built-in
libraries for basic tasks such as image creation
and manipulation, but the QR code encoding logic
should be written by you.

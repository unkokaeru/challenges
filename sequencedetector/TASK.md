                 Sequence Detector
---------------------------------------------------
The goal of this challenge is to detect the pattern
in a list of numbers, lets say of a length three or
more. For example, in the series...

... [3, 6, 9], we know that it is simply adding 3
each time, and so, the computer should determine
that the next number in the series should be 12.

... [4, 16, 64], each number is multiplied by 4, so
the next number in the series is 256.

Your code should be able to detect arithmetic and
geometric sequences, then be able to find the nth
term in the list.

Just a bunch of challenges I've completed.

Each challenge is located within its eponymous directory, along with a TASK.txt detailing what I need to accomplish.
The code should be pretty well documented using NumPy-style docstrings, as good practice, but beyond that it's just my amateur attempt at completing each challenge.

Most of the challenges I complete will be from the [SlothBytes newsletter](https://slothbytes.beehiiv.com/subscribe?ref=zOJ2tJGPlQ)! :-)

Some challenges are really interesting, so their source is replaced with a markdown file containing a link to a separate GitHub repo where I've explored the concepts further - such as my QR Code Generation!

                Prime Factorisation
---------------------------------------------------
Prime factorisation is essential for cryptographic
algorithms, and other applications. The goal is to
produce a list of the smallest prime numbers that
when multiplied produce the original number. For
example:

84 -> [2, 2, 3, 7]
64 -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
83 -> [83] (it is prime)
